# MJML Email Boilerplate
A boilerplate for MJML to make developing email templates a breeze.


## 🏁 Getting started

- Clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:daphnesmit/mjml-email-boilerplate.git`

## 🧘‍♀️ Development server

- Make sure there is a `/dist` folder in the root. (sadly otherwise mjml will compile your file to a dist file without extension...)
- Run `yarn dev` from the root directory

This will run the MJML watch command and outputs your files in the /dist folder.
A simple live-server with hot reloading will be spinned up for the ease of development.


## 📦 Production build

### Production build for Javascript
To output your HTML email templates in a Javascript bundle you first need to make sure they are all required in `index.ts`. (see below: how to use)

- Run `yarn build:js` from the root directory

This will run a webpack build and compiles all your html files in `bundle.js` in the /dist folder


### Production build for HTML
To output your HTML email templates as minified html files:

- Run `yarn build` from the root directory

This will run a mjml build and builds all your minified html files to the /dist folder


## 🚀 How to use
How to use the javascript import. Which is very useful to use the email templates directly in your backend.
First: Require your templates in our entry file `index.ts`.

Example:
```typescript
import index from './templates/index.mjml'
import login from './templates/login.mjml'
import forgotPassword from './templates/forgotPassword.mjml'

export default {
  index,
  login,
  forgotPassword,
}

```

__Use a template__

In your project require the templates from the email folder.  Import path may differ depending on your implementation and where you put the emails folder.

```typescript
import { index, login, forgotPassword } from '@mjml-email-boilerplate'

customSendEmailFunction(login, { /* my options */ })
```

Good luck and Happy coding 🤓!
